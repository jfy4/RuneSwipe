I would like to make a new android game.  Here is a breif description
with a more indepth breakdown below:

A two-person multiplayer game, where two players act as witches/wizards.
To battle they physically swipe on the phone screen pre-defined
rune sigils to cast spells at their opponent. when the sigils are correctly
traced out on the screen the spell is cast.  These sigils must be
memorized before battle, but are stored in a convienient "tome" the
players can reference before their match.  Each spell has a different
effect on the opponent, and the battle ends when the opponent is either
out of "life", or "permanently immobile".  Experience points are gained
after each battle.

* Main mechanic
  - tracing or swiping rune sigils on the phone touchscreen to cast the spell
  - Each spell performs a different action for example:
    + tracing a simple circle couter-clockwise could cast a weak fireball
    + tracing a simple cross could cast a healing spell
    + etc.
  - The more powerful, or more technical a spell is, the more complicated
    and detailed the sigil is to cast.

** The display during battle
   - During battle, the player sees a small avatar of their opponent (along with their
     life, status effects, etc.), and a blank space to trace out their sigils on the phone.
   - Upon accurately tracing a known sigil, an animation displays showing the effect of
     the spell.

* Spells
** Types
   - Attack: these deal damage
   - Defense: these provide protection, mitigating or nullifying spell damage
   - Healing: These regain player life
   - Status: These aflict the opposing, or casting, player with status effects
             (e.g. poison, extra defence etc.)

** Tome
   - Every players has a tome which lists the rune sigils they know how to cast.
   - The tome also acts as a skill tree, revealing new spells as more experience is
     gained.

* Players
** Attributes
   - Life (int): The total health of a player.  This is diminished by attacks or status effects.
   - Strength (int): Attack modifier---directly affects how strong the spell is---I'm not sure if this is multiplicative of additive...
   - Defense (int): Defense modifier---directly affects how the player handles the spell if
                   it is an attack---Again not sure what the equation is to use here.
   - Constitution (int): Defense modifier, but for status ailments.
   - Speed (int): How quickly you can cast another spell after another (not sure how to integrate this either)
   - Dexterity (int): The ability of the player to dodge a spell.
   - Experience points (int): The current about of experience the player has.
   - Level (int): The players level.  This grows as the player gains more experience, pushing them
                  over level threasholds.  This also governs the skill tree---larger levels
		  reveal more and new spells.
** Items
   - the players can wear gear that affects their attributes:
     + Robes
     + wands
     + hats
     + etc.
** Extras
   - Not a priority, but ideally each player can customize their appearance as well.

* Practical Extras
** Data loading
   - Need some sort of way to import all the spells in the game, maybe a .csv
   - Ideally lets just start with a couple simple spells to get it working.
** Networking
   - Need to set it up so that players can play one another over the internet
   - I assume this is difficult, and can be saved till later if so.



Can you write the code to make this game please?
